Given a number N, return a string of integers 1 to N, but use “Fizz” in place of an integer if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.

E.g. If N = 16, the output should be
````
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8

Buzz
11
Fizz
13
